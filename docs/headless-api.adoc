Enonic is a highly flexible CMS, capable of delivering content in many ways. In this {document} we will focus on delivery via the out-of-the-box GraphQL API.

Now that we've created some content, let's see how we can access and use it in via API - headless style. 

== Guillotine

Introducing _Guillotine_, the app that's responsible for automatically generating a GraphQL APIs for your content.

Guillotine should be pre-installed based on the `Essentials` template you used when setting up your sandbox. It is available on https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/guillotine[Enonic Market], and may also be installed manually.

== Query playground

Back in Content Studio, you should now have access to a new item called `Query Playground` in the left green widget sidebar. Open it, and you should see this:

image::query-playground-empty.png[API browser integrated in Content Studio, 602w]

Query playground is an interactive GraphQL API explorer. You enter your query in the text area to your left and when you execute it, you'll get the results of the query on the other side of the screen.

GraphQL is a graph "query language". It allows you to create highly specific queries for exactly the content that you need (visit the https://graphql.org/learn/[official GraphQL docs to learn more]).

As an example on how to retrieve some minimal info about your previously created artists, run the following query:

[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    getChildren(key:"/artists") {
      displayName
      _path
      _id
    }
  }
}
----

After running, you should get something like this on the right area:

.Results of running the suggested query

=== Basic buttons

Before trying to come up with complex queries, let's make familiarize ourselves with Query Playground.

=== Schemas

Now, locate and click on the docs button. On this opened section you have detailed info about all https://graphql.org/learn/schema/[schemas] available on your project.

On the top search bar in the docs section, search for `artist` and locate the `com_example_myproject_Artist` schema:

.The Artist schema
image::query-playground-artist-schema.png[Query playground docs section showing the details of com_example_myproject_Artist schema, 666w]

Note that it's said that the `Artist` schema _implements_ the `Content` schema. This basically means that the `Artist` schema will have the structure defined by the `Content` schema, together with possibly some additional structure... in this case, that additional structure is a `data` field, defined by `com_example_myproject_Artist_Data` schema:

.The Artist data schema
image::query-playground-artist-data-schema.png[Query playground docs sections showing the details of com_example_myproject_Artist_Data schema, 666w]

NOTE: Note that this matches the structure defined by the Artist content type, which is a natural thing to expect.  

=== Querying with inline fragments

We've used the Docs section to inspect the structure of the `Artist` schema. Let's now, based on a broader understanding of this schema, we'll query to get proper data from artists.

Close the docs section, head back to the text area to edit your query and remove `displayName`, `_path` and `_id` from the query we introduced earlier.

Now, with your cursor on the inner curly braces of the query, press kbd:[ctrl+space] to get a list of suggestions about what fields you can request on your query:

image::query-playground-artist-query-inspection.gif[Query playground query section showing suggested fields for content schema, 545w]

As can be seen, we do not have the artist `name` and `about` fields available, and the reason for that is because the `getChildren` field can return any content that implements the `Content` schema, but it can't directly infer what schema that is, which in this case is the `com_example_myproject_Artist` schema:

.getChildren can't directly infer what schema is implementing Content schema
image::query-playground-getChildren-infer.png[Query playground getChildren can't directly infer what schema is implementing Content schema, 276w]

So to proceed, we use https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments[inline fragments]:

[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    getChildren(key: "/artists") {
      ... on com_example_myproject_Artist {
        _id
        data {
          name
          about
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

With this, we basically built a query that understands that under `"/artists"` path we have content types of `Artist`, and based on this we can request general content data, such as `_id`, but also specific content data, such as the artist name and about:

.Getting specific data of artists
image::query-playground-artists-data.png[Query playground query returning artists content together with its name and about data, 945w]

=== Query with dataAsJson

If you don't need or care about types when creating your queries, you can ignore the previously presented inline fragment approach and use the field `dataAsJson`:

[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    getChildren(key: "/artists") {
      _id
      dataAsJson
    }
  }
}
----

.Getting all data using dataAsJson
image::query-playground-artists-dataAsJson.png[Query playground query returning artists content together with is name and about data, but using dataAsJson field, 945w]

== Advanced queries

We'll now introduce and show examples of usages of different fields underneath the `guillotine` field, that allow us to search the system for specific data.

=== QueryDsl

There is a `queryDsl` field underneath `guillotine` which allows you to search the system for what you want (the "Dsl" stands for "Domain Specific Language").

The syntax is based on two types of operators: `Expressions` and `Compound`.

`Expression`:: Used to check particular fields for various native and analysed values.
`Compound`:: Used to logically combine various expressions and compounds to fetch nodes based on complex conditions.

In order to exemplify this field usage on some queries, we'll query on the data set we've created so far on in this guide:

.A Guillotine query using some of the arguments mentioned.
[source,GraphQL,{subs}]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(
      query: {
        term: {
          field: "type",
          value: {
            string: "{project-name-full}:{content-type-1}"
          }
        }
      },
      first: 1,
      sort: {
        field: "displayName",
        direction: DESC
      }
    ) {
      _id
      displayName
    }
  }
}
----

Note that this query is getting the last artist that is alphabetically sorted by name, regardless of where the content type is located in the tree structure.

The following GraphQL query uses the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/storage/dsl#ngram[n-gram functionality] to find all the {content-type-1}s that have a term (part of a text) that starts with `rap` somewhere in their data:

.A Guillotine query using _nGram_ search functionality
[source,GraphQL,{subs}]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(
      query: {
        boolean: {
          must: [
            {
              term: {
                field: "type",
                value: {
                  string: "{project-name-full}:{content-type-1}"
                }
              },
              ngram: {
                fields: ["_allText"],
                query: "rap"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      sort: {
        field: "displayName",
        direction: DESC
      }
    ) {
      _id
      displayName
    }
  }
}
----

Naturally, you can also use the standard boolean operators to combine or negate clauses. If you wanted to find all {content-type-1}s that mention both rapping and singing, you could try a query like this:

.Querying for {content-type-1}s who both rap and sing
[source,GraphQL,{subs}]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(
      query: {
        boolean: {
          must: [
            {
              term: {
                field: "type",
                value: {
                  string: "{project-name-full}:{content-type-1}"
                }
              }
            },
            {
              ngram: {
                fields: "data.about"
                query: "rap sing"
                operator: AND
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      sort: {
        field: "displayName",
        direction: DESC
      }
    ) {
      _id
      displayName
    }
  }
}
----

NOTE: If you've previously used Elasticsearch API to query data, you'll be quite familiar with how `queryDsl` works!

TIP: To learn more about queryDSL capabilities, visit the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/storage/dsl[DSL reference]

=== QueryDslConnection

Just like there is a `queryDsl` field underneath `guillotine`, the API also provides other fields such as `queryDslConnection`.

We'll not go into much details, but basically, the fields with _connection_ in their name have new parameters for aggregating and paginating data.

To finish this {document}, we'll add a new _birthyear_ field to the artist content type, update all artist to have data on this field, and then use `queryDslConnection` field to get aggregated data. Let's get to work!

. Start by updating the Artist content type to the following structure: 

[source, xml]
----
<content-type>
  <display-name>Artist</display-name> 
  <description>Information about an artist</description> 
  <super-type>base:structured</super-type>
  <form> 

    <input name="name" type="TextLine"> 
      <label>Name</label>
      <help-text>
        The artist's name (if different from their professional moniker).
      </help-text>
    </input>

    <input type="TextArea" name="about">
      <label>About the artist</label>
    </input>

    <input type="Date" name="birthday" >
      <label>Birthday</label>
    </input>

  </form>
</content-type>
----

TIP: If are not running the project in dev mode (`enonic project dev` introduced in the previous ${document}), make sure to run `enonic project deploy` in the terminal on the project's root directory

[start=2]

. Update each of the previously created artists with the following dates:

- P!nk: 1979-09-08
- Missy Elliot: 1971-07-01
- Cardi B: 1992-10-11

. Go back to Query playground and click on the _re-fetch schema button_. This will update the Artist data schema to contain the birthday structure, which is in sync with the Artist content type structure

. Run the following query on the playground:
+
[source,GraphQL,{subs}]

{
  guillotine {
    queryDslConnection(
      query: {
        boolean: {
          must: {
            term: {
              field: "type"
              value: {
                string: "{project-name-full}:{content-type-1}"
              }
            }
            exists: {
              field: "data.birthday"
            }
          }
        }
      }
      aggregations: {
        name: "generationsAggregation"
        dateRange: {
          field: "data.birthday"
          ranges: [
            {
              key: "The Greatest Generation"
              from: "1901"
              to: "1927"
          	}
            {
              key: "The Silent Generation"
              from: "1928"
              to: "1945"
          	}
            {
              key: "The Baby Boomer Generation"
              from: "1946"
              to: "1964"
          	}
            {
              key: "Generation X"
              from: "1965"
              to: "1980"
          	}
            {
              key: "Millennials"
              from: "1981"
              to: "1996"
          	}
            {
              key: "Generation Z"
              from: "1997"
              to: "2012"
          	}
            {
              key: "Gen Alpha"
              from: "2013"
              to: "2025"
          	}
          ]
          }
        }
    )
    {
      aggregationsAsJson
    }
  }
}

Which shows that two of those artists are from Generation X, and one of them is a Millenial.
