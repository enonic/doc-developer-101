Naturally, XP can also store any files you would want to serve or associate with any data. This {document} explores how XP stores uploaded data and focuses on how its image tools work. At the end of a chapter we'll walk through how to use images in a headless fashion.

NOTE: {see-prev-docs}. This {document} requires that you've got your site up and running.

{
  guillotine {
    getChildren(
      key: "${site}/images") {
      displayName
      ... on media_Image {
        imageUrl(type: absolute, scale: "block(3000,200)")
      }
    }
  }
