In this {document}, we'll start exploring how to create and expose content from your XP instance. To achieve this, we'll create a new application and generate a GraphQL API, and we'll learn about _content types_. But before we can get going with the application, we'll install and have a look at Content Studio, XP's content authoring suite.

== Preparing your sandbox

As we've seen previously, having a locally running sandbox is essential for XP development, so either spin up your sandbox from earlier or create a new one.

If you already have a sandbox that you want to use, you can use the command

  enonic sandbox start

The CLI will prompt you for which sandbox you want to start. If you're following along from the previous {document}, feel free to use the `tutorial` sandbox we created there.

If you don't have a sandbox set up, follow the xref:basics#_sandboxes[setup steps in the previous {document}] to set up a sandbox and then come back here.

Once your sandbox is up and running, navigate to the admin dashboard at {xp-url}. If you followed the steps in the xref:basics#_admin-console[admin console section of the previous {document}], you should already have installed Content Studio, and it should show up in the XP menu on the right.

NOTE: If there is no XP menu on the right-hand side of the window, you can open it by clicking the XP button in the top right corner.

If you did not install Content Studio previously, you can either:

- take the "XP tour" by clicking the XP tour button on the admin home screen. At the final step of this short tour, you will be prompted to be installed a few applications, including content studio.
- navigate to the "Applications" menu entry in the XP menu. Once on the Applications page, click the "Install" button and search for Content Studio in the popup menu. Be aware that you want "Content Studio" and _not_ "Content Studio+".

When you've got Content Studio up and ready to go, find Content Studio in the XP menu and follow the link. Alternatively, you can also find it at {cs-url}[at its own URL] if everything's been installed and is running correctly.

=== The empty studio (204 No content)

When opening Content Studio, you might find that it's telling you that "you are wasting this space".

We can't select anything if we don't have any content. However, before we can start to create any content, we need to create an application. In XP, content is linked to applications, and applications dictate what types of content they can work with. So let's create a project!

== Create a headless API project

This section walks the user through creating a new project using the headless starter. We've already created a project previously, so it needn't be _as_ detailed as previously, but should still provide all the necessary instructions.

NOTE: Projects are a new feature in Content Studio, introduced in 7.3.0. They are not essential and for a small demo like this would probably cause more issues than they solve. However, it's probably worth sticking a note in here, telling the users that there is a more advanced concept called projects which is useful for working with multiple sites/contexts. We might explore this later.

After creating the site, we'll see that there are no content types! The only things we can create are folders, shortcuts, sites, and template folders. We'll change that in the next section.

// Mention that content types belong to apps

== My first content type

This section gives a brief explanation of XP content types: what they are and how to create them. By doing this, it also introduces the directory structure of an XP app.

We'll keep it light for now and only introduce what we need.

After creating the content type, we'll open Content Studio and check it out + create an instance of the content type.

== Querying the API

Now that we've created some content, how about we try and query the API to see if we can fetch it?

Introduces the GraphQL API (and mentions that it's automatically generated by Guillotine) and how to use it.
