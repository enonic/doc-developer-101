X-data (short for _eXtra-data_) is a way for you to dynamically add extra data to some or all content types belonging to a site. In Content Studio, they'll be displayed as a separate field set below the content type's normal fields.

NOTE: {see-prev-docs}

By configuring your application's `site.xml` (`src/main/resources/site/site.xml`) you can select which X-data schemas to add and to which content types, and whether to make the X-data optional or not. Go to the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/x-data[X-data documentation] to read more about how.

As per usual, X-data schemas follow this naming and placement convention: `src/main/resources/site/x-data/<x-data-name>/<x-data-name>.xml`.

== Task: add reference data

For the {content-type-2}s we've created thus far, we've brought in data and images from Wikipedia, but we haven't indicated this anywhere. If we wanted to indicate where we got some information from, we could do it using X-data. Your task is:

- Create a new X-data type. Call it {x-data}.
- It should have a single input field, "reference", that can have as many occurrences as the user wants
- Add the X-data to your site, but only to the `{content-type-2-capitalized}` content type.
- Try adding some references to one of your {content-type-2}s.

==== Solution

The X-data schema is very similar to the content type schemas we've worked with previously, so there's no real surprises here; just remember to wrap everything in an `x-data` tag:

.The {x-data} X-data schema
[source,xml,{subs}]
----
<x-data>
  <display-name>{x-data-Capitalized}</display-name>
  <form>
    <input type="TextLine" name="notes">
      <label>Notes</label>
      <occurrences minimum="0" maximum="0" />
    </input>
  </form>
</x-data>
----

Next, you need to reference the X-data in your `site.xml` and tell XP what content types it applies to. To do that, add an `x-data` tag in `site.xml` that has a `name` attribute that matches the name of your X-data ({x-data}). Make sure you add the `x-data` element before the `form` and `mappings` elements.

.The updated site.xml
[source,xml,{subs}]
----
<site>
  <x-data name="{x-data}" allowContentTypes="{project-name-full}:{content-type-2}"/> <--.-->
  <form/>
  <mappings>
    <mapping controller="/controllers/graphql.js" order="50">
      <pattern>/api</pattern>
    </mapping>
  </mappings>
</site>
----

<.> We use a regular expression to restrict which content types the X-data should apply to. In this case: only to `{content-type-2-capitalized}`

Now, if you open Content Studio, you should be able to add references to your {content-type-2-capitalized} content:

.{content-type-2-capitalized} with {x-data}
image::x-data-example.png["The content form for Lion with an additional 'References' section below the usual inputs. The first reference, a TextLine input, points to the Wikipedia article.'", {image-xl}]


== Headless

When working headlessly, you can easily fetch X-data by querying for the `x` property of your content type. This query will fetch

.Querying for X-data
[source,GraphQL,{subs}]
----
{
  guillotine {
    query(contentTypes:"{project-name-full}:{content-type-2}",
      query: "displayName = 'Lion'") {
      ... on {project-name-query}_{content-type-2-Capitalized} {
        x {
          name
          data
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

So if you've added some references to your "Lion", you'll get something like this back:

.X-data results
[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "query": [
        {
          "x": [
            {
              "name": "com-example-myproject:notes",
              "data": "{references=Lion (Wikipedia): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion}"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
