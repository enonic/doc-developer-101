X-data (short for _eXtra-data_) is a way for you to dynamically add extra data to some or all content types belonging to a site. In Content Studio, they'll be displayed as a separate field set below the content type's normal fields.

NOTE: {see-prev-docs}

By configuring your application's `site.xml` (`src/main/resources/site/site.xml`) you can select which X-data schemas to add and to which content types, and whether to make the X-data optional or not. Go to the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/x-data[X-data documentation] to read more about how.

As per usual, X-data schemas follow this naming and placement convention (from the project root): `src/main/resources/site/x-data/<x-data-name>/<x-data-name>.xml`.

NOTE: X-data share some similarities to mixins (which we saw in the <<sets#_mixins, {document} on sets>>), but they work at a higher level. Both allow you to group fields and add them, but mixins add fields to a content type's form, while X-data adds fields to a piece of content itself. Further, you configure X-data at a global level, while you configure mixins at a content type level.

== Task: add reference data

For the {content-type-2}s we've created thus far, we've brought in data and images from Wikipedia, but we haven't indicated this anywhere. If we wanted to indicate where we got some information from, we could do it using X-data. The end result will have extra form fields to add references.

.{content-type-2-capitalized} with an added X-data _{x-data}_ field set.
image::x-data-empty.png["The reindeer content form with an added field set labeled {x-data} at the end of the form.",{image-xl}]

Your task is:

- Create a new X-data type. Call it "{x-data}".
- It should have a single input field, "references", that can have as many occurrences as the user wants
- Add the X-data to your site, but only to the `{content-type-2-capitalized}` content type.
- Try adding some references to one of your {content-type-2}s.

==== Solution

. Create the {x-data} schema in the file `src/main/resources/site/x-data/{x-data}/{x-data}.xml`. The X-data schema is very similar to the content type schemas we've worked with previously, so there's no real surprises here; just remember to wrap everything in an `x-data` tag:
+
.The {x-data} X-data schema
[source,xml,{subs}]
----
<x-data>
  <display-name>{x-data-Capitalized}</display-name>
  <form>
    <input type="TextLine" name="notes">
      <label>Notes</label>
      <occurrences minimum="0" maximum="0" />
    </input>
  </form>
</x-data>
----

. Add a reference the X-data in your `site.xml` and tell XP what content types it applies to. To do that, add an `x-data` tag in `site.xml` that has a `name` attribute that matches the name of your X-data ({x-data}). Make sure you add the `x-data` element before the `form` and `mappings` elements.
+
Like with fields within a content type form, X-data can be optional or required. If X-data is optional, you need to manually add it to a piece of content. If it is required, it will be added automatically. Note that a piece of X-data being required does not mean that its fields are required. To mark X-data as optional, use `optional="true"` as described under the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/x-data#configuration[X-data configuration section in the XP reference docs].

+
.The updated site.xml
[source,xml,{subs}]
----
<site>
  <x-data name="{x-data}" allowContentTypes="{content-type-2}"/> <--.-->
  <form/>
  <mappings>
    <mapping controller="/controllers/graphql.js" order="50">
      <pattern>/api</pattern>
    </mapping>
  </mappings>
</site>
----
+
<.> We use a regular expression to restrict which content types the X-data should apply to. In this case: only to `{content-type-2-capitalized}`. To reference types outside of the current project, preface the type name with the project name. E.g. `{project-name-full}:{content-type-2}`. For content types belonging to the current project, that's not necessary.

. Now, open Content Studio, and add references to your {content-type-2-capitalized} content:
+
.{content-type-2-capitalized} with references added
image::x-data-example.png["The content form for Lion with an additional 'References' section below the usual inputs. The first reference, a TextLine input, points to the Wikipedia article.'", {image-xl}]

== Headless

When working headlessly, you can easily fetch X-data by querying for the `xAsJson` field of your content type. This query will return the content's associated X-data as a JSON object.

.Querying for X-data
[source,GraphQL,{subs}]
----
{
  guillotine {
    query(contentTypes:"{project-name-full}:{content-type-2}",
      query: "displayName = 'Lion'") {
      xAsJson
    }
  }
}
----

So if you've added some references to your "Lion", you'll get something like this back. Notice how the JSON data is structured in a hierarchical fashion.

.X-data results
[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "query": [
        {
          "xAsJson": {
            "com-example-myproject": {
              "notes": {
                "references": "Lion (Wikipedia): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
