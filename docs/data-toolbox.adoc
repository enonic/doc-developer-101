In this {document}, we'll give a short introduction to a popular application called Data Toolbox, the developers best friend for playing around with the low level NoSQL storage in Enonic XP.

== Web interface

Data Toolbox provides you with a web interface to visualize and manipulate your XP data, as well as other system related information. We'll now see how to inspect content using Data Toolbox.

Data Toolbox is https://market.enonic.com/vendors/glenn-ricaud/data-toolbox[available on Enonic Market^].

Just like Content Studio, Data toolbox should already have been installed, and can be launched from XP Admin: `XP menu` -> `Data Toolbox`.

== Examine your content

Follow these steps to find and examine what your content looks like from the low level storage perspective:

. Navigate to the `Data Tree` in the menu. Here, the toolbox lists repositories within your XP instance, you should at least have the following:
+
com.enonic.cms.my-first-project:: This is the current repository that holds your content.

com.enonic.cms.default:: This is the default repository.

system.auditlog:: This is where the _audit log_ is stored. The audit log allows you to see a log of everything that's been done in your XP instance, such as content creation, user administration, etc., and also tells you when it was done and by whom.

system-repo:: This is where XP stores core data about your system, such as installed applications and users.

system.scheduler:: This is a separate repository where scheduled jobs are stored.

. Move into `com.enonic.cms.my-first-project`. Here you will see two branches (as discussed above). As long as you've published your content, you can choose either one of these.

. Keep navigating further down the tree: `root` -> `content`. Now you should see all the content of your site listed. Navigate to `{content-type-1}s` to find actual pieces of content.

. Choose one of your {content-type-1}s and check out both the info view and the JSON view, available via the buttons in the table row.
+

+
. To inspect the data associated with the {content-type-1}, you can select "Display properties", which will bring up data about the node, such as its display name, its owner, when it was created, etc.

+
. Finally, you can navigate to the `data` property, where you'll find the data stored on the {content-type-1}.

== Summary

Inspecting content is only a fraction of what Data Toolbox can do: it's a versatile and powerful administrative tool, and we'll see more of it in a later {document}.

Now, let's have a look at the <<headless-api#, cutting edge headless cms API - aka Guillotine>>.
