Before we can start building, let's make sure we have the right tools available to start developing efficiently with XP. In general, they are:

- Basic command line (a.k.a _terminal_) knowledge -> _executing commands through text_
- Enonic CLI -> _managing your XP projects_
- Git and Github -> _versioning your XP projects_
- Integrated Development Environment -> _coding your ideas into XP projects_

If you've already got those configured and installed, feel free to skip to the next chapter.

== The command line

The command line is a powerful, text-based interface for running commands on your computer. You can also use the terminal to navigate your file system, similar to macOS`' Finder or Windows`' Explorer. The program running in the terminal (that interprets your commands) is known as a _shell_.

If you are insecure about basic terminal knowledge, we recommend the following introductory guides (depending on your operating system):

- https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/[macOS]
- https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089[Windows]
- https://www.howtogeek.com/140679/beginner-geek-how-to-start-using-the-linux-terminal/[Linux]

When we ask you to _"run a command"_ later on in this document, you can assume that we're asking you to run it in a terminal unless otherwise specified.

== The Enonic CLI

Enonic provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for working with XP. 

If the concept of CLI is new to you, you can imagine it as an interactive terminal program that will listen for some specific inputs (usually as text), and based on them, execute specific tasks on your machine.

The goal of the CLI is to improve the development workflow, and, by using it, you'll have an easy and quick way to manage your XP apps.

=== Installation

The easiest and fastest way to install the CLI is by using Node Package Manager (NPM):

[source,shell]
----
npm install -g @enonic/cli 
----

Note that to run the npm install command you need to make sure that you have both Node and NPM installed on your machine. You can quickly check if they are installed by running the following commands on your terminal:

[source,shell]
----
node -v
----

to check the version of Node you have installed locally. Same for NPM:

[source,shell]
----
npm -v
----

If they are not installed, you can head to https://nodejs.org/[nodejs.org] to proceed installing them.

[NOTE]
====
Enonic CLI is also available on other package managers, such as https://developer.enonic.com/start#brew[brew] for MacOS, https://developer.enonic.com/start#scoop[scoop] for Windows and https://developer.enonic.com/start#curl[Snapcraft] on Linux.
====

=== Verification

After running the installation command above, you can check if the Enonic CLI was properly installed by running

[source,shell]
----
enonic -v
----

=== Commands

Let's first list some commands... run the following command in your terminal:

[source,shell]
----
enonic
----

It should output something that looks a bit like this:

.Main help page

[source,shell]
----

If you want to know more about how to use one of the subcommands, you can use the `help` subcommand. For instance, if you want to know more about the `sandbox` subcommand, you can run:

[source,shell]
----
enonic sandbox help
----

.Sandbox help page

[source,shell]

   upgrade, up      Upgrades the distribution version.

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help
----

As can be seen, there are a lot of commands and their subcommands to help you. On this guide, we'll only cover the necessary ones to be able to start developing on XP.

NOTE: Consider checking the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/stable[CLI documentation] to further investigate its capabilities.  

== Git

Git is a free and open source _distributed version control system_. Later on in this tutorial, we will create new Enonic development projects using _starters_. The Enonic CLI uses Git to download these starters and to prepare the files for your project locally.

TIP: Want to learn more about Git? Check out https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/[this useful Git handbook by Github].

=== Installation

To install Git, follow the notes for your operating system below.

==== macOS

NOTE: Apple maintains its own fork of Git. If you have XCode installed, you already have Git installed too.

To install Git via Homebrew, run this command:

[source,shell]
----
brew install git
----

==== Windows

To install Git using Scoop, run the following command from Powershell:

[source,shell]
----
scoop install git
----

==== Linux

To install Git with Snapcraft, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
sudo snap install git
----

=== Verification

Once you have installed Git, you can verify that it's working correctly by running the following command:
[source,shell]
----
git version
----

== Integrated Development Environment

Source-code editors (also known as _text editors_ or just _editors_ for short) are applications designed primarily for editing plain text and often specifically for working with code. They are therefore commonly used for programming.

If you do not yet have an editor you like, follow the steps below to get started with one.

=== Download Visual Studio Code

https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] (often shortened to _VS Code_ or simply _Code_) is one of the most popular source-code editors around at the moment. It's free, open source, and available on all major platforms.

You can navigate to their https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[download page] and install the version matching your operating system. 

If you opt to move forward with VS code as your IDE, its worth checking some of the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/[powerful extensions] available on their marketplace.

== Summary

Congrats! You've installed the Enonic CLI, Git, and an IDE. You're now set up to start working with Enonic XP ðŸš€

Keep your new tools at hand; we'll be using them heavily throughout this guide, so you'll have lots of time to get to know them better.
