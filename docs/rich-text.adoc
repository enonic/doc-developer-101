= Rich text: HtmlArea
include::variables.adoc[]

When you want to ... rich text is the way to go, and if you want to work with rich text in Content Studio, HtmlArea is your friend.

We briefly mentioned the HtmlArea input type in the previous {document}, but didn't say much about it -- not because there's nothing to be said about it. The situation is actually quite the opposite. This rich text input type offers some very powerful editing capabilities and a lot of configuration options. As such, this whole {document} is dedicated to that one input type, how it works, and how to use it in a headless fashion.

== The HtmlArea: an overview

.The default HtmlArea input type
image::input-type-html-area.png[HtmlArea: A rich text input field with visible formatting options., width=600]

The HtmlArea input type gives you a multi-line input field with rich formatting options, much like what you're used to from your favorite word processor. It supports text formatting and justification, lists, links, and even lets you insert images.

You can configure the HtmlArea to be exactly what you want by dictating what formatting tools to include or exclude (the `include` and `exclude` attributes, respectively), by what heading levels are allowed (`allowedHeadings`), and by giving it a default value (`default`).

Additionally, the HtmlArea supports the use of _macros_. Macros let you automatically insert arbitrary markup into your rendered content and is perfect for cases when you want to add banners, add footers, contact info, or the like. // <- TODO: might need to rethink this ðŸ¤”

== Configuration of text tools

We can use the HtmlArea's `config` section to specify which rich text controls should be available when editing. Using a combination of the `include` and `exclude` tags, we can customize the input's appearance.

If you want to include all controls, use `<include>*</include>` as shown below:

.The HtmlArea configured to include everything
[source,xml]
----
<input type="HtmlArea" name="everything">
  <label>HtmlArea with 'include *'</label>
  <config>
    <include>*</include>
  </config>
</input>
----

If you want to exclude all controls, use `<exclude>*</exclude>`:


.The HtmlArea configured to include nothing
[source,xml]
----
<input type="HtmlArea" name="nothing">
  <label>HtmlArea with exclude: *</label>
  <config>
    <exclude>*</exclude>
  </config>
</input>
----

Finally, if you want to exclude most tools, but not all, you can exclude all and then add back in the ones you want:

.The HtmlArea configured to include a selection of controls
[source,xml]
----
<input type="HtmlArea" name="something">
  <label>HtmlArea with some controls</label>
  <config>
    <exclude>*</exclude>
    <include>Format | Bold Italic Underline | JustifyBlock
    JustifyLeft JustifyCenter JustifyRight |HorizontalRule Blockquote</include>
  </config>
</input>
----

== Images

If you have configured your HtmlArea to include the image tool, you can click the image button to insert an image. Once you select an image, you'll get a prompt that allows you to customize the image. You can add a caption, alt text, change the image's justification in the block, and apply predefined styles. There's also a pencil icon in the upper right corner that allows you to edit the image. This icon takes you to Content Studio's image editing facilities where you can edit the image by cropping, rotating, or flipping it. You can also add an image focal point, so that if the image gets cropped for some reason, you're in control of what part of the image remains visible.

== Macros

What are they?

=== Using macros

=== Creating our own macro

== Rich text in a headless context

HtmlArea spits out HTML. What does this mean for headless contexts? Do you want that? Could it be updated to support spitting out other formats in the future?

=== GraphQL queries

Create multiple queries, demonstrating what happens to the macros and to images (including srcset). You should also have a query that provides params to the images to get them at a certain width.

== Configuration

The HtmlArea comes with lots of options to configure. Most importantly, you can configure what tools are available for editors to work with, so you can tailor the experience to exactly what you want it to be.

Show how the HtmlArea can be configured to have nothing, everything, or something in between.
