== The mighty HtmlArea

image::input-type-html-area.png[HtmlArea: A rich text input field with visible formatting options., width=800]

While the TextLine input type is great for short inputs, it doesn't handle paragraphs of text very well, and it also doesn't provide any options for text formatting. For that, we have the HtmlArea.

The HtmlArea input type gives you a multi-line input field with rich formatting options, much like what you're used to from your favorite word processor. It supports text formatting and justification, lists, links, and even lets you insert images.

You can configure the HtmlArea to be exactly what you want by dictating what formatting tools to include or exclude (the `include` and `exclude` attributes, respectively), by what heading levels are allowed (`allowedHeadings`), and by giving it a default value (`default`).

To learn more about HtmlArea input type and how to configure all its options, check the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/input-types#htmlarea[reference documentation for it]. A fully HtmlArea could look like this:

.An example HtmlArea input type
[source,xml]

<input name="myhtmlarea" type="HtmlArea">
  <label>My HtmlArea</label>
  <default><h3>Enter description here</h3></default>
  <config>
    <exclude>*</exclude>
    <include>JustifyLeft JustifyRight | Bold Italic</include>
    <allowHeadings>h2 h4 h6</allowHeadings>
  </config>

== Config

Show how the HtmlArea can be configured to have nothing, everything, or something in between.

== Macros

What are macros? What are they used for? _How_ do you use them? Can you make your own?

== In a headless context

HtmlArea spits out HTML. What does this mean for headless contexts? Do you want that? Could it be updated to support spitting out other formats in the future?
