Naturally, XP can also store any files you would want to serve or associate with your content. This {document} explores how XP stores uploaded data and focuses on how its image tools work. At the end of the chapter we'll walk through how to use images in a headless fashion.

NOTE: {see-prev-docs} This {document} requires that you've got your site up and running.

== Media 

=== Types

Media types are standard content types that ship with XP. When you upload a file to XP, XP will assign it one of a number of preexisting media types based on the file's content. Some common media types are images, audio, video, and executables.

For a full overview of all the media types baked into XP, see the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/content-types#media[reference docs for media content types].

=== Upload

To upload files to Content Studio, use the "create content" dialog. You can either click the "upload" icon in the dialog or you can drag and drop the files from your file explorer.

.Dragging and dropping files to the "create content dialog"
image::media-drag-and-drop.png["The drag and drop interface. Three file icons being dragged onto a large, blue, circular drop zone.",{image-m}]

This process is the same for whatever media type you want to upload.

To get familiar with uploading media to XP, let's start with one of the most common media types on the web: images! As mentioned above, this process will also work for any other media type.

. Find an image to upload. For the purposes of the tasks in this {document}, you should work with an image where the important part isn't centered in the shot. If you have one yourself, feel free to use that. If not, how about using https://unsplash.com/photos/8oLnCRz7hwM[this picture of a lion] by https://unsplash.com/@keyursphotography[Keyur Nandaniya]?

. Create a folder for your images. Call it "{image-folder}". Just like the "{content-type-1}" folder we created previously, you may place the folder anywhere in your project structure.
. Open the "create content" dialog. Press the upload button to bring up your OS's file browsing dialog and select your image. You can also drag and drop the image from your file system browser onto the dialog.

And that's all it takes to upload files to Content Studio!

=== Data Toolbox

Like we saw in the {document} on content, Data Toolbox lets you view and edit your content. Images and other media are also available in Data Toolbox as content, but in addition to the same properties you saw previously, media also have a property called `attachment`. The attachment specifies the actual media file that you have uploaded.

For instance, if you have a look at the image you uploaded earlier, you should see that it points to the image file you uploaded. 

If you added a focal point, you'll see that specified under the `media` property too. 

If you view the content as JSON, some relevant parts of the structure are the `data` and `attachment` properties:

.An extract of the JSON representation of an image
[source,json]
----
// ....
  "data": {
    "media": {
      "attachment": "lion.jpg", // <1>
      "focalPoint": { // <2>
        "x": 0.246875,
        "y": 0.6653906106948853
      }
    }
  },
  "attachment": { // <3>
    "name": "lion.jpg",
    "label": "source",
    "binary": "lion.jpg",
    "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
    "size": 256018,
    "text": ""
  }
// ....
----

<1> References the name of the attachment specified in the `attachment` property.
<2> If you have set a focal point, its position will also show up here. See the next task for how to set one.
<3> The image attachment with data about the file, such as MIME type and size.


== XP's image service

Whenever XP serves you an image, the image is served via https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/engines/site-engine/image-service[XP's image service].

The image service takes care of scaling and applying filters to your images based on parameters you give it. For instance, it's common to want to have all images in a section conform to the same dimensions. But because images are generally of different shapes and sizes, this might require cropping the image. The image service takes care of that for you as long as you specify what you want.

The image service works in tandem with Content Studio's image editing tools, so it respects crops, flips, and focal points that you create.

== Editing images

Content Studio comes with a suite of image editing tools built in. After uploading an image to Content Studio, you can find it in the content grid and edit it to bring up the image's content form.

.The image content form
image::image-content-form.png["A content form showing the image with image editing tools, inputs for caption, alternative text, copyright, and tags.",{image-xl}]

The content form allows you to provide an image caption, alt text, copyright and tag info. 

You can also add image properties such as dimensions, and where the image was taken and with what gear. 

NOTE: Changing these properties, including size, width, height, etc, does not affect the image in any way.

The image editing tools allow you to crop, flip, and rotate the image as well as to set what's known as _autofocus_. 

The autofocus control allows you to set an image focal point that XP will always keep in view, regardless of how the image is cropped.

NOTE: Without setting a focal point, XP will focus around the center of the image when cropping.

You can always reset the edits you've made to an image by using the 'reset filters' button.

TIP: You can read more about https://enonic.com/blog/enonic-simplifies-image-problems[how Enonic simplifies your everyday image problems] to get more info about how to use images in a traditional CMS model and for a quick overview of the autofocus feature.

=== Autofocus

Because we chose an image with an off-center subject, the image might get cropped such that the lion disappears from the image. For instance, a small, square crop might turn out like this:

.Cropped image without focal point
image::image-cropped-unfocused.jpg["A crop of the lion in the savannah image. The image is square and the only part of the lion that is visible is part of its hind leg.",{image-s}, align=center]

To get around this, try the autofocus tool.

. Click the autofocus tool. A red circle will show up over the image. This circle indicates where the focal point is.
. Move the circle onto the lion (or whatever your focal point is) and press "apply".
+
.The focal point editor
image::image-editing-focal-point.png["The lion image with a red circle indicating the focal point around its head.",{image-xl}]

Now, when the image gets cropped, XP will take care of keeping the lion in focus, both in traditional CMS solutions and in headless modes:

.The same image with the same crop, but with a focal point
image::image-cropped-focused.jpg["A crop of the lion in the savannah. In this square image, the lion is in full view square in the center.", {image-s}, align=center]

== Attachments

XP has an input type named https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/input-types#attachmentuploader[AttachmentUploader] that enables uploading of one or more files that will be stored as attachments to the current content. 

This differs from the previously presented media content, which is a separate content itself that can be linked on other content types, for example, by using the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/input-types#imageselector[ImageSelector] input type.

To take a look on how attachments work, let's update the Artist content type to use the input type _AttachmentUploader_. 

. For that, update the _Artist.xml_ file accordingly:
+
[source, xml]
----
<content-type>
  <display-name>Artist</display-name> 
  <description>Information about an artist</description> 
  <super-type>base:structured</super-type>
  <form> 

    <input name="name" type="TextLine"> 
      <label>Name</label>
      <help-text>
        The artist's name (if different from their professional moniker).
      </help-text>
    </input>

    <input type="TextArea" name="about">
      <label>About the artist</label>
    </input>

    <input type="Date" name="birthday" >
      <label>Birthday</label>
    </input>

    <input type="AttachmentUploader" name="attachments">
      <label>Attachments</label>
      <occurrences minimum="0" maximum="0"/> // <1>
    </input>

  </form>
</content-type>
----
+
<1> _minimum="0"_ shows that this is not a required field, while _maxiumum="0"_ shows that we can upload as many attachments as we want.

+
. Redeploy your app
. Add some attachments to each of the three artists. In my case I'll add images of some of their albums:
+
image::artists-attachments.png[Edit form of all artist content types, showing the attachments that were uploaded on each of them, {image-xl}]

With that, we have not only enhanced the Artist content type with a new structure, but also added files as attachments to all three artists.

On the next section we'll show how we can retrieve this information through queries.

== Headless API

Guillotine makes it easy to fetch the data that you've uploaded. 

Some functionality is shared between all media types, while other queries only work on specific media types. 

We'll look at how to fetch general media and then have a closer look at what we can do with images and attachments.

=== General media type

To get the resource URL of media you have uploaded, use the `mediaUrl` property on any media type. For instance, to get the URL of the raw image you uploaded previously, you could use a query like this:

[source, GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    query(
      contentTypes: "media:image"
    ) {
      displayName
      ... on media_Image { // <1>
        mediaUrl // <2>
      }
    }
  }
}
----

<1> This allows us to query properties that belong to the `media:Image` GraphQL type.
<2> The `mediaUrl` property (also available on all other media types) gives you a URL from where the raw file can be downloaded.

.The response would look something like this:
[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "query": [
        {
          "displayName": "keyur-nandaniya-8oLnCRz7hwM-unsplash",
          "mediaUrl": "/admin/site/preview/my-first-project/draft/_/attachment/inline/21f827e0-ba57-4824-b3bc-f101ae08568b:9475135781b315daad078d91c27746bc3222d024/keyur-nandaniya-8oLnCRz7hwM-unsplash.jpg"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

=== Image media type

XP supports a number of image manipulation functions on the fly. When querying for an image via the GraphQL API, you can use the `imageUrl` function to specify scale and filters for the result you want.

The scale argument is `required` and allows you to specify how you want to crop the image. Common scaling functions include _block_, which allows you to specify width and height and _width_ which scales the image proportionally to the specified width. 

TIP: https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/engines/site-engine/image-service#scaling_methods[The scaling methods reference docs] show off all the available scaling functions with examples of how they affect the image.

As the name implies, the filters argument lets you apply filters to the image. Use filters to apply coloration functions and to rotate and flip images on the fly. To combine filters, separate them with a semicolon.

TIP: https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/engines/site-engine/image-service#filters[The filters documentation] has an exhaustive list of the available filters.

For instance, we could get all the images under the `images` folder, scaled to 600x700 pixels, in grayscale, with a query like this:

.A GraphQL query that both scales and applies a filter to images in the `images` folder
[source, GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    query(
      contentTypes: "media:image"
    ) {
      displayName
      ... on media_Image {
        imageUrl( // <1>
          type: absolute, // <2>
          scale: "block(600,700)", // <3>
          filter: "grayscale(); border(10, 0x000000)") // <4>
      }
    }
  }
}
----

<1> The `imageUrl` function lets you specify how you want the images to look.
<2> The `type` argument specifies whether the URL should be absolute or relative to the server.
<3> The scale argument specifies the dimensions of the image.
<4> The filter argument lets you apply filters.

The above query should return a response that looks a little something like this:

.A response with a cropped image with filters
[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "query": [
        {
          "displayName": "keyur-nandaniya-8oLnCRz7hwM-unsplash",
          "imageUrl": "http://localhost:8080/admin/site/preview/my-first-project/draft/_/image/21f827e0-ba57-4824-b3bc-f101ae08568b:6d89657e4bfae6eaa62de22bd6fb63b2697f091d/block-600-700/keyur-nandaniya-8oLnCRz7hwM-unsplash.jpg?filter=grayscale%28%29%3B+border%2810%2C+0x000000%29"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

Which, if you have followed the steps in this {document}, should show you something like this if you try and navigate to the `imageUrl` property value:

.The processed image
image::image-processed.jpg["The lion image, cropped, in black and white, and flipped upside down.",{image-s}, align=center]


=== Attachments

Let's understand how we can retrieve artists attachments through queries.

First, access the GraphQL API docs on query playground and search for the `Content` schema.  Scroll down a bit and you'll note that there is a field name _attachments_. Now look for the `com_example_myproject_Artist_Data` schema. You'll also note that, after the changes on the Attachments section, we also have a _attachments_ field there, of the same type _Attachment_ of the previous one

This means that we can get the attachments for each artist in two ways:

. By directly querting the attachments field in the `Content` schema, without the need of inline fragments
. Using inline fragments and accessing the `com_example_myproject_Artist_Data` schema, since there is also a _attachments_ field there

Let's access the attachments in both ways, starting with the query that access the attachments field on the `Content` schema level:

[source, GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    getChildren(key: "/artists") {
      ... on com_example_myproject_Artist {
        _id
        data {
          name
          about
        }
      }
      attachments {
        name
        attachmentUrl(type: absolute)
      }
    }
  }
}
----

And if everything went fine, you should expect a response that looks like this:

[source, json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "getChildren": [
        {
          "_id": "4d6862b1-3867-46cc-9705-b0291543b807",
          "data": {
            "name": "Alecia Beth Moore",
            "about": "Alecia Beth Moore (born September 8, 1979), known professionally as Pink (stylized as P!nk), is an American singer and songwriter."
          },
          "attachments": [
            {
              "name": "The_Truth_About_Love.png",
              "attachmentUrl": "http://localhost:8080/admin/site/preview/my-first-project/draft/_/attachment/inline/4d6862b1-3867-46cc-9705-b0291543b807:9b8af457d28aeb4332d4ed4b6cc35e63ed462a64/The_Truth_About_Love.png"
            },
            {
              "name": "cant-take-me-home-pink.webp",
              "attachmentUrl": "http://localhost:8080/admin/site/preview/my-first-project/draft/_/attachment/inline/4d6862b1-3867-46cc-9705-b0291543b807:c0bb06a49c8c862c5d6a01bb64bf3ba0aa777da9/cant-take-me-home-pink.webp"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "_id": "46d8e610-3b31-4ea4-85c8-a7ae1751977f",
          "data": {
            "name": "Melissa Arnette Elliott",
            "about": "Melissa Arnette Elliott (born July 1, 1971) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer."
          },
          "attachments": [
            {
              "name": "Under_Construction_Cover.jpg",
              "attachmentUrl": "http://localhost:8080/admin/site/preview/my-first-project/draft/_/attachment/inline/46d8e610-3b31-4ea4-85c8-a7ae1751977f:dd920d59b9ba0ded890d85bbc614cf752a43899a/Under_Construction_Cover.jpg"
            },
            {
              "name": "supa-dupa-fly-album-cover.jpg",
              "attachmentUrl": "http://localhost:8080/admin/site/preview/my-first-project/draft/_/attachment/inline/46d8e610-3b31-4ea4-85c8-a7ae1751977f:9a54d122bb13f50fa6bc368b22843cb661ddebc0/supa-dupa-fly-album-cover.jpg"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "_id": "79b30fd8-93b5-4f1c-b17c-36e34bc0767f",
          "data": {
            "name": "Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar",
            "about": "Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar (born October 11, 1992), known professionally as Cardi B, is an American rapper and songwriter."
          },
          "attachments": [
            {
              "name": "Cardi_B_-_Invasion_of_Privacy.png",
              "attachmentUrl": "http://localhost:8080/admin/site/preview/my-first-project/draft/_/attachment/inline/79b30fd8-93b5-4f1c-b17c-36e34bc0767f:15db0b6d84901296b64994d682fdcd904b0bdf8c/Cardi_B_-_Invasion_of_Privacy.png"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

Now accessing attachments field on `com_example_myproject_Artist_Data` schema level:

[source, GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    getChildren(key: "/artists") {
      ... on com_example_myproject_Artist {
        _id
        data {
          name
          about
          attachments {
            name
            attachmentUrl(type: absolute)
          }
        }
      }
      
    }
  }
}
----

And if everything went fine, you should finally expect a response that looks like this:

[source, json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "getChildren": [
        {
          "_id": "4d6862b1-3867-46cc-9705-b0291543b807",

            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

As can be seen, both ways retrieve the same data, but since their access is different, the response structure is also slighly different.

TIP: Under the hood, the _attachment_ field argument _attachmentUrl_ uses Enonic's javascript lib portal https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/api/lib-portal#attachmenturl[attachmentUrl] function, so you can follow the link to better understand the arguments that you pass to this field when creating queries that uses it.
