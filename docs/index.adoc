include::variables.adoc[]

This tutorial is an in-depth guide to getting started with the Enonic platform. It covers installing the necessary tools, running your own instance of Enonic XP, and how to work with content on the Enonic platform.

If you're looking for the _tl;dr:_, then head on over to the https://developer.enonic.com/start[quickstart page] to install the Enonic CLI and build your first XP app in minutes.

More content will be coming to the guide shortly ( ... ish).
